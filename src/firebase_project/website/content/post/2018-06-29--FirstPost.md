We're very excited to announce the launch of the Open INcentive Kit or
OINK for short. OINK is a collaborative effort between [Lab11][lab11]
from the University of California, Berkeley and the [STIMA Lab][stima]
at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

The goal of OINK is to create a general framework for deploying and
running incentive-based studies. Currently, the vast majority of
incentive-based studies either manually manage their incentives or need
to create new, custom incentive software for every new deployment.

## Current Status

Today, OINK is just beginning. An early version of OINK is powering the
DumsorWatch deployment, part of the larger [GridWatch][gridwatch]
project. With this first deployment, we aim to learn whether the OINK
architecture design supports the needs of a real-world project well.

## Can I use OINK for my project?

Probably not yet.

Deploying, configuring, and monitoring OINK as it stands is a heavily
manual process.  As we learn what works well in the DumsorWatch
deployment, and build the management tools around the system, we hope to
see OINK grow to serve the needs of the greater research community.
We'll be tracking our progress and announcing major milestones here, we
welcome all to follow along on the adventure!
