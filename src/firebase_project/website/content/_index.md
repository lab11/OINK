# Welcome to the Open Incentive Kit

The Open Incentive Kit, OINK, is a platform for running and managing
incentive-based studies. With OINK, experimenters set up a series of rules that
express when and how study participants should be incentivized. OINK monitors a
study, automatically triggers incentives and handles disbursements.
